Assumptions for implementation:

The solution uses Java 1.7 Compliance

All relationships are built as per the given table in the problem statement.

After getting clarity from a member on the Slack platform an attempt has been made to get only the valid relationships in case of ambiguity

Please use names of the individuals as they appear in the family tree image.
Eg: In the image the individual name is 'Lavnya' and in the input it is used as 'Lavanya'. Spelling mistakes will return wrong results

Only 3 problems have been solved.(Working on the 3rd problem as time permits. Will resubmit the complete code once done.)

Following is the exhaustive list of relationships that is handled in this implementation:

	-Grand Father
	-Grand Mother
	-Father
	-Mother
	-Children
	-Son
	-Daughter
	-Grand Son
	-Grand Daughter
	-Grand Children
	-Spouse
	-Brothers
	-Sisters
	-Siblings
	-Maternal Uncle
	-Maternal Aunt
	-Paternal Uncle
	-Paternal Aunt
	-Brother-in-law
