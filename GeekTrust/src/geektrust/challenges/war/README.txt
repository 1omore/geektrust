Greetings

This is my first ever code submission to GeekTrust.

I am familiar with other Coding Sites' standards as they have an inpage code editor where we paste the code.

This at GeekTrust is something new for me and I have made an assumption and sent the file this way.

Let me know if this is an acceptable format of code submission and if not then let me know the correct way to do it.

Note: The program takes input as given in the Sample Input and Output only e.g: Falicornia attacks with 250 H, 50 E, 20 AT, 15 SG

Thanks
